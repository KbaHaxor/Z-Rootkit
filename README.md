Z-Rootkit
=========

In the 10th Semester, Spring 2014, A Team put together an impressive Linux rootkit during the Computer &amp; Netw. Security course. It features a remote keylogger and hiding of processes + sockets. Project Description by TA: Amr Tj. Wallas

1- Introduction
===============
Our project is concerned with engineering a linux rootkit, which is typically a
malicious loadable kernel module designed to hide certain activities from the
administrator of a system, or a network of systems. The complexity of rootkits
arises not from the difficulty of their implementation, but rather from the
difficulty to detect their presence as they could easily mislead the software
intended to discover their presence.
